## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 What

A web-based management system for a Thai print/sign shop that handles the complete lifecycle from customer order → graphic design → customer approval → production → payment → delivery.

### 1.2 Why

Current pain points:
- 1,361 outstanding payment records with no aging visibility
- Staff spends 2+ hours/day answering "is my job ready?" inquiries
- No visibility into production bottlenecks
- No formal design approval — leads to costly reprints
- Manual price calculation and document generation
- No connection between LINE orders and job management

### 1.3 Who

Primary users: Counter Staff, Graphic Designers, Production Operators, Accountant, Shop Owner. Secondary users: Customers (via LINE and web tracking page).

### 1.4 Current System

Running at `192.168.1.53` with existing data: 7,396 completed jobs, 259 customers, 14 users, 23 product categories, 13 customer types.

---

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Reduce "is my job ready?" calls | Customer inquiries per day | -70% within 3 months |
| Improve payment collection | Outstanding payments aging > 30 days | -40% within 6 months |
| Reduce reprints from miscommunication | Revision rate after production | < 5% |
| Increase production visibility | Jobs with accurate status | 100% |
| Speed up order intake | Average time to create a job | < 3 minutes |
| Owner visibility | Time to get business overview | < 30 seconds (dashboard) |
